    <h1 id="temperature-control-systems">Temperature Control Systems:</h1>
    <p>Temperature control systems are used in various industries to maintain specific temperature ranges for processes, equipment, and environments. The choice of system and its tolerance for variation depends on the application. Here are some common temperature control systems and their associated tolerances:</p>
    <h2 id="thermostatic-control-systems">1. Thermostatic Control Systems</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Application: Used in HVAC systems for residential and commercial buildings.</li>
    <li>Tolerance: Typically ±1-3°C (±1.8-5.4°F).</li>
    <li>Details: These systems use a thermostat to maintain a set temperature. They are relatively simple and have a moderate tolerance for variation, suitable for general comfort and basic environmental control.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="pid-proportional-integral-derivative-control-systems">2. PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) Control Systems</h2>

    <li>Tolerance: Typically ±0.1-1°C (±0.18-1.8°F), depending on the system’s tuning.</li>
    <li>Details: PID controllers offer precise temperature control by continuously adjusting the heating/cooling input based on the deviation from the setpoint. They are ideal for processes requiring tight temperature control.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="onoff-control-systems">3. On/Off Control Systems</h2>
    <ul>

    <h1 id="control-chart-selection">Control Chart Selection:</h1>
    <p>To show that the temperature in a system is within tolerance using control charts, you would typically use the following types of control charts:</p>
    <h2 id="x-bar-and-r-range-chart">1. X-Bar and R (Range) Chart</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Purpose: Monitors the process mean (X-Bar) and variability (R).</li>
    <li>Use Case: Suitable for tracking the average temperature over a period of time and the variability within each sampling period.</li>
    <li>How It Works:
    <ul>
    <li>X-Bar Chart: Plots the average temperature of each subgroup/sample over time.</li>
    <li>R Chart: Plots the range (difference between the maximum and minimum values) within each subgroup/sample.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Interpretation: The system is within tolerance if the points remain within the control limits on both the X-Bar and R charts.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="x-bar-and-s-standard-deviation-chart">2. X-Bar and S (Standard Deviation) Chart</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Purpose: Similar to the X-Bar and R chart but uses standard deviation instead of range for variability.</li>
    <li>Use Case: Useful when the sample size is relatively large (e.g., &gt;10).</li>
    <li>How It Works:
    <ul>
    <li>X-Bar Chart: Same as above, tracking the mean.</li>
    <li>S Chart: Tracks the standard deviation within each subgroup/sample.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Interpretation: The process is within tolerance if the mean and standard deviation stay within control limits.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="individual-and-moving-range-i-mr-chart">3. Individual and Moving Range (I-MR) Chart</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Purpose: Monitors the process mean and variability for individual measurements.</li>
    <li>Use Case: Ideal for situations where only one temperature reading is available at a time (e.g., continuous monitoring).</li>
    <li>How It Works:
    <ul>
    <li>I Chart: Plots individual temperature readings over time.</li>
    <li>MR Chart: Plots the moving range between consecutive readings.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Interpretation: The temperature is within tolerance if all points on both the I and MR charts stay within the control limits.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="cusum-cumulative-sum-control-chart">4. CUSUM (Cumulative Sum) Control Chart</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Purpose: Detects small shifts in the process mean over time.</li>
    <li>Use Case: Useful when you’re interested in detecting gradual changes or trends in temperature.</li>
    <li>How It Works:
    <ul>
    <li>The chart accumulates deviations from the target temperature (mean) over time, which helps in identifying small shifts.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Interpretation: The temperature is within tolerance if the cumulative sum remains within control limits.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="ewma-exponentially-weighted-moving-average-control-chart">5. EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) Control Chart</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Purpose: Gives more weight to recent temperature measurements to detect small shifts in the mean.</li>
    <li>Use Case: Suitable for detecting small and gradual changes in temperature.</li>
    <li>How It Works:
    <ul>
    <li>The EWMA chart smooths out the temperature data, making it easier to spot small deviations from the target.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Interpretation: The process is in control (within tolerance) if the EWMA remains within control limits.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="p-chart-proportion-chart">6. P-Chart (Proportion Chart)</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Purpose: Monitors the proportion of temperature readings that are out of tolerance.</li>
    <li>Use Case: If you are recording whether each temperature reading is within or out of tolerance (i.e., pass/fail).</li>
    <li>How It Works:
    <ul>
    <li>The P-Chart tracks the proportion of readings out of tolerance over time.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Interpretation: The process is in control if the proportion of readings out of tolerance is stable and within control limits.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="selecting-the-right-chart">Selecting the Right Chart:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>For Continuous Monitoring: I-MR Chart is typically the best choice.</li>
    <li>For Batch or Subgroup Data: X-Bar and R Chart or X-Bar and S Chart.</li>
    <li>For Detecting Small Shifts: CUSUM or EWMA charts are ideal.</li>
    <li>For Pass/Fail Analysis: P-Chart.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These charts help in visually assessing whether the temperature is consistently within the specified tolerance range, ensuring the process is stable and under control.</p>
